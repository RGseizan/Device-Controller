Device Controller

Here's a two part app made by my team and me.
Took us 5 days, the purpose of this is : the master app can receive and use several devices and informations from the slave app.
Things like : geolocalisation, contact, cameras and so on.
Both devices need to be localy connected tho. 
You can find usable apk in here : http://github.com/RGseizan/Apk.
